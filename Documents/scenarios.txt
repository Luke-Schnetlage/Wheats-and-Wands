Write 3 scenarios describing how a user may use your app.
Each scenario should be 1 - 2 paragraphs.
Use these to identify additional requirements.
Your scenarios should be saved in a document named scenarios.
Use the same file format you used for the requirements. Spell check!

Use Case 1: The casual user
The user opens the game once, plays the tutorial, and proceeds with normal progression until reaching a point too difficult for their liking.
User proceeds to intermittently skip and complete levels until either quitting or completing the final level. 

Use Case 2: The enthusiast
    User opens the game, plays the tutorial, and proceeds with normal progression, all the while collecting optional reward tokens until reaching a difficulty spike. 
    At said spike, the user may become frustrated, save, and close the game for future play. 
    Upon reopening the game, the user may redeem optional reward tokens in exchange for different player skins, 
    select any previously beaten level to collect missed reward tokens, or attempt their lowest unbeaten level again. Eventually, the user will complete the game,
    possibly collecting all optional tokens for “100%” completion

Added requirement: reward_token_progression
