they are still stuck, a skip level option will be provided to complete the level. This will happen until either they quit or complete the final level of the game.

the user may become frustrated, save, and close the game for future play. Upon reopening the game, the user may redeem optional reward tokens in exchange for
different player skins, select any previously beaten level to collect missed reward tokens, or attempt their lowest unbeaten level again. Eventually, the user
will complete the game, possibly collecting all optional tokens for “100%” completion.

saves to ensure file_save method is free of corruption.
